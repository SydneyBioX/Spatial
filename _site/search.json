    "section": "Identifying discrete changes in cell state with Kontextual",
    "text": "Identifying discrete changes in cell state with Kontextual\nCells states can be modelled as subclusters of a broader parent cell population. These subclusters, or states, are typically identified via a hierarchical clustering strategy. By framing cell states as discrete clusters, we are able to explore relationships as follows - cell type A has two states, with state 2 being closer to cell type B.\n\n\nKontext\n\nHere we introduce Kontextual. Kontextual models spatial relationships between cells in the context of hierarchical cell lineage structures. By assessing spatial relationships between pairs of cells in the context of other related cell types, Kontextual provides robust quantification of cell type relationships which are invariant to changes in tissue structure.\n\nFor the purposes of using Kontextual we treat cell states as identified clusters of cells, where larger clusters represent a “parent” cell population, and finer sub-clusters representing a “child” cell population. For example a CD4+ T cell may be considered a child to a larger parent population of T cells. Kontextual thus aims to quantify how the localisation patterns of a child population of cells deviate from the spatial behaviour of their parent population, and how that influences the localisation between the child cell state and another cell state.\nCell type hierarchy\nA key input for Kontextual is an annotation of cell type hierarchies. We will need these to organise all the cells present into cell state populations or clusters, e.g. all the different B cell types are put in a vector called bcells.\nTo make our lives easier, we will start by defining these here. I’m happy to talk about how we use our bioconductor package treekoR to define these hierarchies in a data driven way.\n\n# Set up cell populations\n\ntumour &lt;- c(\"Keratin_Tumour\", \"Tumour\")\n\nbcells &lt;- c(\"B_cell\")\ntcells &lt;- c(\"dn_T_cell\", \"CD4_T_cell\", \"CD8_T_cell\", \"Tregs\")\nmyeloid &lt;- c(\"Dc_or_Mono\", \"DC\", \"Mono_or_Neu\", \"Macrophages\", \"Other_Immune\", \"Neutrophils\")\n\nendothelial &lt;- c(\"Endothelial\")\nmesenchymal &lt;- c(\"Mesenchymal\")\n\ntissue &lt;- c(endothelial, mesenchymal)\nimmune &lt;- c(bcells, tcells, myeloid, \"NK\") \n\nall &lt;- c(tumour, tissue, immune, \"Unidentified\")\n\nDiscrete cell state changes within a single image\nHere we examine an image highlighted in the Keren et al. 2018 manuscript where the relationship between two cell types depends on a parent cell population. In image 6 of the Keren et al. dataset, we can see that p53+ tumour cells and immune cells are dispersed. However when the behaviour of p53+ tumour cells are placed in the context of the spatial behaviour of its broader parent population tumour cells, p53+ tumour cells and immune would appear localised.\n\n# Lets define a new cell type vector\nspe_Keren_2018$cellTypeNew &lt;- spe_Keren_2018$cellType\n\n# Select for all cells that express higher than baseline level of p53\np53Pos = assay(spe_Keren_2018)[\"p53\",] &gt; -0.300460\n\n# Find p53+ tumour cells\nspe_Keren_2018$cellTypeNew[spe_Keren_2018$cellType %in% tumour] &lt;- \"Tumour\"\nspe_Keren_2018$cellTypeNew[p53Pos & spe_Keren_2018$cellType %in% tumour] &lt;- \"p53_Tumour\"\n\n#Group all immune cells under the name \"Immune\"\n\nspe_Keren_2018$cellTypeNew[spe_Keren_2018$cellType %in% immune] &lt;- \"Immune\"\n\n# Add spatialCoords as a reduced dimension\n\n# Plot image 6\n\nspe_Keren_2018 |&gt;\n  colData() |&gt;\n  as.data.frame() |&gt;\n  filter(imageID == \"6\") |&gt;\n  filter(cellTypeNew %in% c(\"Immune\", \"Tumour\", \"p53_Tumour\")) |&gt;\n  arrange(cellTypeNew) |&gt;\n  ggplot(aes(x = x, y = y, color = cellTypeNew)) +\n  geom_point(size = 1) +\n  scale_colour_manual(values = c(\"#505050\", \"#64BC46\",\"#D6D6D6\")) + guides(colour = guide_legend(title = \"Cell types\", override.aes = list(size=3)))\n\n\n\n\nThe Kontextual function accepts a SingleCellExperiment object, or a single image, or list of images from a SingleCellExperiment object, this gets passed into the cells argument. The two cell types which will be evaluated are specified in the to and from arguments. A parent population must also be specified in the parent argument, note the parent cell population must include the to cell type. The argument r will specify the radius which the cell relationship will be evaluated on. Kontextual supports parallel processing, the number of cores can be specified using the cores argument. Kontextual can take a single value or multiple values for each argument and will test all combinations of the arguments specified.\nWe can calculate these relationships for a single radius.\n\np53_Kontextual &lt;- Kontextual(\n  cells = spe_Keren_2018,\n  image = 6,\n  r = 50,\n  from = \"p53_Tumour\",\n  to = \"Immune\",\n  parent = c(\"p53\", \"Tumour\"),\n  cellType = \"cellTypeNew\"\n)\n\np53_Kontextual\n\n  imageID               test  original kontextual  r weightQuantile inhom  edge\n1       6 p53_Tumour__Immune -21.35601    54.9888 50            0.8  TRUE FALSE\n  includeZeroCells window window.length\n1             TRUE convex            NA\n\n\nThe kontextCurve calculates the L-function value and Kontextual values over a range of radii. While kontextPlot plots these values. If the points lie above the red line (expected pattern) then localisation is indicated for that radius, if the points lie below the red line then dispersion is indicated. As seen in the following plot Kontextual is able to correctly identify localisation between p53+ tumour cells and immune cells in the example image for a certain range of radii. The original L-function is not able to identify localisation at any value of radii.\n\ncurves &lt;- kontextCurve(\n  cells = spe_Keren_2018,\n  image = \"6\",\n  from = \"p53_Tumour\",\n  to = \"Immune\",\n  parent = c(\"p53+Tumour\", \"Tumour\"),\n  rs = seq(10, 510, 100),\n  cellType = \"cellTypeNew\",\n  cores = nCores\n)\n\nkontextPlot(curves)\n\n\n\n\nAlternatively all pairwise cell relationships and their corresponding parents in the dataset can be tested. A data frame with all pairwise combinations can be creating using the parentCombinations function. This function takes in a vector of all the cells, as well as all the parent vectors set up earlier. As shown below the output is a data frame specifying the to, from, and parent arguments for Kontextual.\n\n# Get all relationships between cell types and their parents\nparentDf &lt;- parentCombinations(\n  all = all,\n  tumour,\n  bcells,\n  tcells,\n  myeloid,\n  endothelial,\n  mesenchymal,\n  tissue,\n  immune\n)\n\nDiscrete cell state changes across all images\nRather than specifying to, from, and parent in Kontextual, the output from parentCombinations can be input into Kontextual using the parentDf argument, to examine all pairwise relationships in the dataset.

To understand if survival outcomes differ significantly between 2 patient groups, specify type = \"survival\" in colTest. Here we examine which features are most associated with patient survival using the Kontextual values as an example. To do so, survival data is extracted from spe_Keren_2018 and converted into the survival object kerenSurv.\n\n# Extracting survival data\nsurvData = spe_Keren_2018 |&gt;\n    colData() |&gt; \n    data.frame() |&gt; \n    select(imageID, Survival_days_capped., Censored) |&gt; \n    unique()\n\n# Creating survival vector\nkerenSurv = Surv(survData$Survival_days_capped, survData$Censored)\nnames(kerenSurv) = survData$imageID\n\nIn addition to this, the Kontextual results must be converted from a data.frame to a wide matrix, this can be done using prepMatrix. Note, to extract the original L-function values, specify column = \"original\" in prepMatrix.\n\n# Converting Kontextual result into data matrix\nkontextMat = prepMatrix(kerenKontextual)\n\n# Ensuring rownames of kontextMat match up with rownames of the survival vector \nkontextMat = kontextMat[names(kerenSurv), ]\n\n# Replace NAs with 0\nkontextMat[is.na(kontextMat )] &lt;- 0\n\nFinally, both the Kontextual matrix and survival object are passed into colTest, with type = \"survival\" to obtain the survival results.\n\n# Running survival analysis\nsurvivalResults = spicyR::colTest(kontextMat, kerenSurv, type = \"survival\")\n\n\nhead(survivalResults)\n\n                                        coef se.coef    pval adjPval\nMesenchymal__Macrophages__tissue      -0.130  0.0340 0.00017    0.06\nEndothelial__Mono_or_Neu__tissue      -0.035  0.0110 0.00110    0.18\nMesenchymal__Other_Immune__tissue      0.068  0.0220 0.00230    0.18\nTumour__CD4_T_cell__tumour             0.011  0.0036 0.00320    0.18\nMesenchymal__Macrophages__mesenchymal -0.120  0.0410 0.00350    0.18\nCD4_T_cell__CD8_T_cell__tcells         0.250  0.0850 0.00360    0.18\n                                                                    cluster\nMesenchymal__Macrophages__tissue           Mesenchymal__Macrophages__tissue\nEndothelial__Mono_or_Neu__tissue           Endothelial__Mono_or_Neu__tissue\nMesenchymal__Other_Immune__tissue         Mesenchymal__Other_Immune__tissue\nTumour__CD4_T_cell__tumour                       Tumour__CD4_T_cell__tumour\nMesenchymal__Macrophages__mesenchymal Mesenchymal__Macrophages__mesenchymal\nCD4_T_cell__CD8_T_cell__tcells               CD4_T_cell__CD8_T_cell__tcells\n\n\nAs we can see from the results Mesenchymal__Macrophages__tissue is the most significant pairwise relationship which contributes to patient survival. That is the relationship between Mesenchymal cells and macrophage cells, relative to the parent population of all tissue cells. We can see that there is a negative coefficient associated with this relationship, which tells us a decrease in localisation of Mesenchymal and Macrophages leads to poorer survival outcomes for patients.\nThe association between Mesenchymal__Macrophages__tissue and survival can also be visualised on a Kaplan-Meier curve. We must first extract the Kontextual values of this relationship across all images. Next we determine if Mesenchymal and Macrophages are relatively attracted or avoiding in each image, by comparing the Kontextual value in each image to the median Kontextual value. Finally we plot the Kaplan-Meier curve using the ggsurvfit package.\nAs shown below, when Mesenchymal and Macrophages are relatively more dispersed to one another, patients tend to have worse survival outcomes.\n\n# Selecting most significant relationship\nsurvRelationship = kontextMat[[\"Mesenchymal__Macrophages__tissue\"]]\nsurvRelationship = ifelse(survRelationship &gt; median(survRelationship), \"Localised\", \"Dispersed\")\n    \n# Plotting Kaplan-Meier curve\nsurvfit2(kerenSurv ~ survRelationship) |&gt;\n    ggsurvfit() +\n    add_pvalue() +\n    ggtitle(\"Mesenchymal__Macrophages__tissue\")"

    "text": "Identifying continuous changes in cell state\nChanges in cell states can be analytically framed as the change in abundance of a gene or protein within a particular cell type. We can analytically determine whether continuous changes occur to a cell’s state as changes occur in its spatial proximity to another cell type. In the figures below we see the expression of a marker increased in cell type A as it grows closer in spatial proximity to cell type B. This can then be quantified with a scatterplot to determine statistical significance. In the next section of this workshop, we will be exploring the analytical functionalities of Statial which can uncover these continuous changes in cell state.\n\nContinuous cell state changes within a single image.\nThe first step in analysing these changes is to calculate the spatial proximity (getDistances) and abundance (getAbundances) of each cell to every cell type. These values will then be stored in the reducedDims slot of the SpatialExperiment object under the names distances and abundances respectively.\n\nspe_Keren_2018 &lt;- getDistances(spe_Keren_2018,\n                    maxDist = 200)\n\nspe_Keren_2018 &lt;- getAbundances(spe_Keren_2018,\n                     r = 50)\n\nFirst, let’s examine the same effect observed earlier with Kontextual. To avoid redefining cell types we’ll examine the distance between p53-positive tumour cells and macrophages in the context of total keratin/tumour cells for image 6.\nStatial provides two main functions to assess this relationship - calcStateChanges and plotStateChanges. We can use calcStateChanges to examine the relationship between 2 cell types for 1 marker in a specific image. Similar to Kontextual, we can specify the two cell types with the to and from arguments, and the marker of interest with the marker argument. We can appreciate that the fdr statistic for this relationship is significant, and with a negative coef, or coefficient value, indicating that the expression of p53 in keratin/tumour cells decreases as distance from macrophages increases.\n\nstateChanges &lt;- calcStateChanges(\n  cells = spe_Keren_2018,\n  type = \"distances\",\n  image = \"6\",\n  from = \"Keratin_Tumour\",\n  to = \"Macrophages\",\n  marker = \"p53\")\n\nstateChanges\n\n  imageID primaryCellType otherCellType marker         coef      tval\n1       6  Keratin_Tumour   Macrophages    p53 -0.001402178 -7.010113\n          pval          fdr\n1 2.868257e-12 2.868257e-12\n\n\nStatial provides a convenient function for visualising this relationship - plotStateChanges. Similar to Kontextual and calcStateChanges, we can specify the cell types to be evaluated with the to and from arguments and the marker of interest with marker.\nThrough this analysis, we can observe that keratin/tumour cells closer to a group of macrophages tend to have higher expression of p53, as observed in the first graph. This relationship is quantified with the second graph, showing an overall decrease of p53 expression in keratin/tumour cells as distance to macrophages increase.\nThese results allow us to essentially arrive at the same result as Kontextual, which calculated a localisation between p53+ keratin/tumour cells and macrophages in the wider context of keratin/tumour cells.\n\np &lt;- plotStateChanges(\n  cells = spe_Keren_2018,\n  type = \"distances\",\n  image = \"6\",\n  from = \"Keratin_Tumour\",\n  to = \"Macrophages\",\n  marker = \"p53\",\n  size = 1,\n  shape = 19,\n  interactive = FALSE,\n  plotModelFit = FALSE,\n  method = \"lm\")\n\np$image + \n  labs(y = \"p53 expression in Keratin_Tumour\",\n       x = \"Distance of Keratin_Tumour to Macrophages\")\n\n\n\np$scatter\n\n`geom_smooth()` using formula = 'y ~ x'\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion\n\nWhat information does this form of analysis provide that Kontextual does not?\nIs this observation of localisation consistent across images?\nCan you find an interaction where the coefficient is positive? i.e. marker expression in the to cell type rises as distances increases from the from cell type.\n\n\nContinuous cell state changes across all images.\nBeyond looking at single cell-to-cell interactions for a single image, we can also look at all interactions across all images. The calcStateChanges function provided by Statial can be expanded for this exact purpose - by not specifying cell types, a marker, or an image, calcStateChanges will examine the most significant correlations between distance and marker expression across the entire dataset. Here, we’ve calculated all state changes across all images in case you would like to have a play, but first we’ll be taking a closer examination at the most significant interactions found within image 6 of the Keren et al. dataset.\n\nstateChanges &lt;- calcStateChanges(\n  cells = spe_Keren_2018,\n  type = \"distances\",\n  minCells = 100)\n\nstateChanges |&gt; \n  filter(imageID == 6) |&gt;\n  head(n = 10)\n\n   imageID primaryCellType otherCellType       marker         coef      tval\n1        6  Keratin_Tumour  Unidentified           Na  0.004218419  25.03039\n2        6  Keratin_Tumour   Macrophages  HLA_Class_1 -0.003823497 -24.69629\n3        6  Keratin_Tumour    CD4_T_cell  HLA_Class_1 -0.003582774 -23.87797\n4        6  Keratin_Tumour  Unidentified Beta.catenin  0.005893120  23.41953\n5        6  Keratin_Tumour    CD8_T_cell  HLA_Class_1 -0.003154544 -23.13804\n6        6  Keratin_Tumour    DC_or_Mono  HLA_Class_1 -0.003353834 -22.98944\n7        6  Keratin_Tumour      dn_T_CD3  HLA_Class_1 -0.003123446 -22.63197\n8        6  Keratin_Tumour        Tumour  HLA_Class_1  0.003684079  21.94265\n9        6  Keratin_Tumour    CD4_T_cell           Fe -0.003457338 -21.43550\n10       6  Keratin_Tumour    CD4_T_cell   phospho.S6 -0.002892457 -20.50767\n            pval           fdr\n1  6.971648e-127 3.391688e-123\n2  7.814253e-124 3.421451e-120\n3  1.745242e-116 5.660370e-113\n4  1.917245e-112 5.789387e-109\n5  5.444541e-110 1.513574e-106\n6  1.053130e-108 2.837601e-105\n7  1.237988e-105 3.011388e-102\n8  8.188258e-100  1.707242e-96\n9   1.287478e-95  2.348829e-92\n10  3.928912e-88  5.881245e-85\n\n\nIn image 6, the majority of the top 10 most significant interactions occur between keratin/tumour cells and an immune population, and many of these interactions appear to involve the HLA class I ligand.\nWe can examine some of these interactions further with the plotStateChanges function. Taking a closer examination of the relationship between macrophages and keratin/tumour HLA class I expression, the plot below shows us a clear visual correlation - as macrophage density increases, keratin/tumour cells increase their expression HLA class I.\nBiologically, HLA Class I is a ligand which exists on all nucleated cells, tasked with presenting internal cell antigens for recognition by the immune system, marking aberrant cells for destruction by either CD8+ T cells or NK cells.\n\np &lt;- plotStateChanges(\n  cells = spe_Keren_2018,\n  type = \"distances\",\n  image = \"6\",\n  from = \"Keratin_Tumour\",\n  to = \"Macrophages\",\n  marker = \"HLA_Class_1\",\n  size = 1,\n  shape = 19,\n  interactive = FALSE,\n  plotModelFit = FALSE,\n  method = \"lm\")\n\np$image + \n  labs(y = \"HLA_Class_1 expression in Keratin_Tumour\",\n       x = \"Distance of Keratin_Tumour to Macrophages\")\n\n\n\np$scatter\n\n`geom_smooth()` using formula = 'y ~ x'\n\n\nWarning: Removed 1359 rows containing non-finite values (`stat_smooth()`).\n\n\nWarning: Removed 1359 rows containing missing values (`geom_point()`).\n\n\n\n\n\nNow, we can take a look at the top 10 most significant results across all images.\n\nstateChanges |&gt; head(n = 10)\n\n       imageID primaryCellType otherCellType     marker         coef\n69468       37     Endothelial        Tumour       Lag3 -0.001621517\n144255      11     Neutrophils            NK       CD56 -0.059936866\n16402       35      CD4_T_cell        B_cell       CD20 -0.029185750\n16498       35      CD4_T_cell    DC_or_Mono       CD20  0.019125946\n4891        35          B_cell    DC_or_Mono phospho.S6  0.005282065\n16507       35      CD4_T_cell    DC_or_Mono phospho.S6  0.004033218\n4885        35          B_cell    DC_or_Mono     HLA.DR  0.011120703\n5043        35          B_cell  Other_Immune          P  0.011182182\n16354       35      CD4_T_cell      dn_T_CD3       CD20  0.016349492\n4888        35          B_cell    DC_or_Mono     H3K9ac  0.005096632\n                tval          pval           fdr\n69468  -1.334186e+14  0.000000e+00  0.000000e+00\n144255 -1.405002e+14  0.000000e+00  0.000000e+00\n16402  -4.057355e+01 7.019343e-282 4.097869e-277\n16498   4.053436e+01 1.891267e-281 8.280867e-277\n4891    4.041385e+01 5.306590e-278 1.858782e-273\n16507   3.472882e+01 4.519947e-219 1.319365e-214\n4885    3.415344e+01 8.401034e-212 2.101927e-207\n5043    3.414375e+01 1.056403e-211 2.312717e-207\n16354   3.391901e+01 1.219488e-210 2.373110e-206\n4888    3.399856e+01 3.266533e-210 5.720973e-206\n\n\nImmediately, we can appreciate that a couple of interactions appear a bit strange. One of the most significant interactions occurs between B cells and CD4 T cells, where CD4 T cells are found to increase in CD20 expression when in close proximity to B cells. Biologically, CD20 is a highly specific ligand for B cells, and under healthy circumstances are usually not expressed in T cells.\nCould this potentially be an artefact of calcStateChanges? We can examine the image through the plotStateChanges function, where we indeed observe an apparent localisation between B cells and T cells.\n\nQuestion\n\nAre there any other interactions here that you think might not make biological sense?\nDoes the relationship between T cell CD20 expression and B cell proximity occur across images?\n\nWhy are the majority of most significant interactions occurring in image 35?\nHINT: Configure the parameters of plotStateChanges to examine some these other significant interactions. Do they look like artefacts?\n\n\n\n\np &lt;- plotStateChanges(\n  cells = spe_Keren_2018,\n  type = \"distances\",\n  image = \"35\",\n  from = \"CD4_T_cell\",\n  to = \"B_cell\",\n  marker = \"CD20\",\n  size = 1,\n  shape = 19,\n  interactive = FALSE,\n  plotModelFit = FALSE,\n  method = \"lm\")\n\np$image + \n  labs(y = \"CD20 expression in CD4_T_cell\",\n       x = \"Distance of B_cell to CD4_T_cell\")\n\n\n\np$scatter\n\n`geom_smooth()` using formula = 'y ~ x'\n\n\nWarning: Removed 26 rows containing missing values (`geom_smooth()`).\n\n\n\n\n\nSo why are T cells expressing CD20? This brings us to a key limitation of cell segmentation.\nContamination (Lateral marker spill over)\nContamination, or more specifically known as lateral marker spill over, is an issue that results in a cell’s marker expressions being wrongly attributed to another adjacent cell. This issue arises from incorrect segmentation where components of one cell are wrongly determined as belonging to another cell. Alternatively, this issue can arise when antibodies used to tag and measure marker expressions do not latch on properly to a cell of interest, thereby resulting in residual markers being wrongly assigned as belonging to a cell near the intended target cell. It is important that we either correct or account for this incorrect attribution of markers in our modelling process. This is critical in understanding whether significant cell-cell interactions detected are an artifact of technical measurement errors driven by spill over or are real biological changes that represent a shift in a cell’s state.\n\nTo circumvent this problem, Statial provides a function that predicts the probability that a cell is any particular cell type - calcContamination. calcContamination returns a dataframe of probabilities demarcating the chance of a cell being any particular cell type. This dataframe is stored under contaminations in the reducedDim slot of the SpatialExperiment object. It also provides the rfMainCellProb column, which provides the probability that a cell is indeed the cell type it has been designated. E.g. For a cell designated as a CD8+ T cell, rfMainCellProb could give a 80% chance that the cell is indeed CD8+ T cell, due to contamination.\nWe can then introduce these probabilities as covariates into our linear model by setting contamination = TRUE as a parameter in our calcStateChanges function. However, this is not a perfect solution for the issue of contamination.
