We are a multidisciplinary team of researchers developing methods to help solve complex global problems, from designing predictive biomarkers of disease progression to ensuring the sustainability and quality of food production.

## Our priorities
We work on the principle that successful and sustainable collaboration grows organically within the right environment. To this end, our priorities for success are to:

- embrace data science challenges by developing innovative, fit-for-purpose applied methods in synergistic partnerships with key data-generating centres at Sydney and beyond

- address data challenges with high societal impact and to build sustainable approaches

- provide an incubator for interdisciplinary careers

- establish a collaborative community that reflects and values diversity.
